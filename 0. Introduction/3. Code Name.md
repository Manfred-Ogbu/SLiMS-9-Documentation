As an appreciation to the indigenous floras of Indonesia, we begin to place a code name, since Senayan 3 Stable 14 release, to SLiMS releases, so our users can learn about the diversity of floras in Indonesia. As in this release, we named it after a Bulian tree. SLiMS 9 Bulian.

Bulian is native to Brunei; Flores, Java, Kalimantan and Sumatra in Indonesia; the Sabah and Sarawak states of Malaysia; and the Sulu Archipelago of the Philippines. It is threatened by habitat loss. The government of Indonesia and the state government of Sarawak have formally banned the export of this species. Illegal smuggling continues to be a major problem.
